PocketVue is a desktop app for Mac uses Electron and Vue.js
![Transitions Gif](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11825776/TagFiltersTransition-Github.gif)

It is still in development. The initial goal was to explore the capabilities of using VUE and electron.

However, the plan is to integrate more robust features that allow for editing and customization of a user's pocket articles.

Right now, this is for Mac only. You can download the latest version at the [Releases Page](https://github.com/davidroyer/pocketvue/releases)

If you ever want to authorize the app then you can visit the [Connected Services and Applications](https://getpocket.com/connected_applications) page on Pocket's Website and remove access.
